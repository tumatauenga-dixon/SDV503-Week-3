# SDV503-Week-3

#Lab Zero
I learnt about Git through an application called VSCode - a coding application redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. During the course, we were taught to use Git in repository structuring and organization by participating in various Git focused activities such as a website called, "Learning Git Branching" which taught us the basics in branching in a fun and interactive way, a "GitMasters" activity that got 3-6 of us in a group as we attempted to create our own branch from our GitMaster origin/master branch, and then merge the two together - thereby sharing the data between them in a compiled form.

We were also encouraged to share our depositories with the class, allowing us to see and compare fellow students' work. By collaborating with other students, we were all able to cooperate with one another and suggest different ideas/theories when another person was running into their own problems or issues.

As Git itself is a new concept for me, being able to interact effectively with classmates and in return gain a better understanding of the Git language, makes for an increasingly educational experience where I can use their knowledge of Git to expand my own. In cases outside of the classroom, our tutor has given us the ability to contact him, or even other students, though a specialized channel.

I now have a firm understanding of Git branching because of this, and have even managed to solve problems not explicitly taught in our classes. For example, by looking through GitKraken - a visual representation of my Git coding, I realised that the mistakes I had made prior to my completion of the GitMaster challenge were keeping me from merging my specialized branch (named tazdixon) with the origin/master branch.

However, after troubleshooting and getting external suggestions from my colleagues, I figured out the problem and was able to correct it.

I believe this has been taught to give us a better look, and easier understanding of Git as a whole. By initially participating in minor and less complex sides of the language, we as a class were able to gain a limited understanding of Git as a whole before being taught harder and more complex coding techniques.

#Lab One
The focus this week was Javascript, and more specifically the use of functions and variables. During the course, we were taught to use VSCode in order to manipulate/create Javascript code by participating in various activities orientated around the usage of Javascript. For example, were directed to FreeCodeCamp: a large collection interactive Javascript coding lessons. Paired with our own Slack channel specifically to post progress, it makes for a fun and collaborative activity. We were also given direction to a more game-oriented learning platform called CodeCombat: essentially wat it says on the tin, a video game built around different coding languages. In this case, I was using Javascript but other languages are available to learn this way. 

I am very new to Javascript, however I have used it occasionally in my work with HTML and CSS. With the limited information I have prior to the course, I feel as if I was able to effectively expand on my initial Javascript introduction. I have come to learn a bunch of useful coding techniques through this. These can be applied through variables and math, which is near universal -- seeing as not only numbers can be used, but strings also. It's allowed me enough creative freedom to produce my own mini projects. 

Because of the option to share my problems and issues with the class and tutor, as well as being told to share my progress with Slack, any gaps in my understanding or knowledge can easily be restored with the help of others. This makes for any limited understanding to be expanded, and any issues to be solved quickly -- as the result of a shared information hub. 

From what I've come to immediately understand, is that Javascript is a very universal and easy to use coding language. While initially the process is complicated, once you've understood the foundation of what you're doing, the rest seems to line up in a way that makes it easier to understand and therefore learn/use. I have no doubt that with continued usage and learning of the language that I could potentially use it in a work-based environment productively.
